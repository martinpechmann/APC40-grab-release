# APC40-grab-release
Modification of the original controller script using the new Max for Live framework. This adds methods for grabbing and releasing APC controls through M4L. Originally made for use with a Max for Live device: [APC Device Navigation](http://www.maxforlive.com/library/device/3056/apc-device-navigation).

Installation: Copy the folder named `APC40_Mod` from the download archive to `[Live installation directory]\Resources\MIDI Remote Scripts`.
